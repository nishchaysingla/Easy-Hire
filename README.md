Sales Position Candidate Classification Model

Introduction: This project aims to develop a classification model to predict whether a candidate should be hired for a sales position at Piramal Finance. The model utilizes both basic machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques along with natural language processing (NLP) for text data extraction from resumes.

Dataset:

The training data is stored in a CSV file named train.csv.
The CV_Train folder contains resumes of all candidates applying for the sales position.
Workflow:

Data Collection:

The training dataset includes candidate names and relevant features for classification.
Resumes are collected from the CV_Train folder.
Text Data Extraction:

Basic NLP techniques are employed to extract information from resumes.
Extracted text features are added to the existing DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:

Various columns in the CSV file are processed, converting text to meaningful data.
Encoding techniques such as label encoding or target mean encoding are applied to categorical variables.
Handling Missing Data:

Missing data is identified and handled appropriately using techniques like imputation.
Model Training:

A Random Forest classifier is trained on the processed data to predict the suitability of candidates for the sales position.
Hyperparameter tuning may be performed to improve model performance.
Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure the model's robustness.
Files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with candidate information.
CV_Train folder: Contains resumes of candidates.
preprocess.py: Python script for data preprocessing.
model.py: Python script for model training and evaluation.
Usage:

Ensure Python environment with necessary libraries is set up.
Run preprocess.py to preprocess the data.
Execute model.py to train the classification model and evaluate its performance.
Results:

The trained model's performance metrics are documented.
Model predictions on the test dataset are stored for further analysis.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates the development of a classification model for hiring suitable candidates for sales positions at Piramal Finance. By leveraging ML, DL, and NLP techniques, the model provides valuable insights for decision-making in the hiring process.

Future Improvements:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to improve model performance.
Incorporate advanced NLP techniques for better feature extraction from resumes.
Enhance data preprocessing techniques to handle diverse datasets effectively.
Deploy the model in a production environment for real-time candidate evaluation.
